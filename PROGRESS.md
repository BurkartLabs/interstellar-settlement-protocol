# ISP — handoff

**2026-09-25, Builder (Sonnet 5), non-visual session (no CONTROL_URL, no Chrome extension attached — see
"Blind spot" below). Rewritten merging this session's ISP-67 work with a parallel session's AB#1747 fix that
landed on main the same day.**

## What's now true

- **ISP-67 (AB#756) is done.** The PM re-scoped it on 2026-09-23 after Bug #710/#1021 shipped most of it; what
  was left was the anonymous and expired-token edges, and they're now proven rather than assumed:
  - `io.use` keeps the raw token on `socket.data.token`, not just its verdict, so it can be re-verified later
    against the clock it is checked at.
  - A new `checkSocketAuth(socket)` re-verifies that token on demand. If it has expired since the handshake, the
    socket leaves its account room, loses `socket.data.accountId`, and is sent `auth:expired` — dropped back to
    anonymous, not disconnected.
  - `emitToAccount` calls it for every socket in the room before delivering, so an expired member is evicted and
    skipped in the same pass that would have sent it the event — "the first event after expiry" from the
    acceptance line is literally the next per-account emit attempt.
  - `chat:send` calls it too, so a write from a socket whose token has since expired fails closed instead of
    trusting the account id cached at connect time.
  - Client: `app.js` listens for `auth:expired` and calls the existing `refreshSessionToken()`, which already
    reconnects the socket with a fresh token (Bug #710's `reauthenticateSocket()`) — so a live tab recovers
    without a reload, the acceptance line's "reconnecting with a fresh token restores them."
  - New tests in `tests/integration/socket-rooms.test.js`: an anonymous socket gets the public events and none
    of `finance:updated`/`mining:updated`/`notifications:new` in the same run that produces all four; a token
    that expires mid-connection stops per-account delivery, fires `auth:expired`, and a fresh connection is
    unaffected; an expired-token socket's `chat:send` is dropped rather than sent as the account. All three
    fail against the pre-fix code (checked by reverting the fix and re-running).
  - **Known boundary, not closed by this story:** `emitMarketUpdated`/`emitForumsUpdated` and the local chat
    room-by-system lookup still read `peer.data.accountId` directly rather than through `checkSocketAuth`, so a
    socket whose token has expired but is still connected keeps seeing "this is your own listing" highlighting
    and local chat for its last-known system until it does something that calls `checkSocketAuth` (a per-account
    emit, or `chat:send`). Nothing per-account or financial leaks through this path — market/forum views are
    public data with viewer-relative highlighting, not private state — but it's a real gap between "anonymous"
    and "actually anonymous" worth a follow-up if the Board wants it airtight.
  - Security answer (acceptance #6): an anonymous or expired-token socket sees exactly the signed-out view —
    `state:init`'s shared state with no viewer, and the four global events — and nothing derived from an
    account; a forged `accountId` in a payload is never read (the server always uses `socket.data.accountId`,
    set only from a verified token), and `chat:send`'s existing content/length/channel checks are untouched.
- `/api/auth/login`, `/register` and `/refresh` are rate-limited (ISP-64, AB#752): 10 login attempts/minute
  per address, 5 failed logins per account per 15 minutes (lockout keyed on email, not address; the no-email
  fallback goes through express-rate-limit's own `ipKeyGenerator`, not a raw `req.ip` — AB#1747, fixed the
  `ERR_ERL_KEY_GEN_IPV6` startup log the first version left), 5 registrations/hour per address, 60
  refreshes/minute per address. `trust proxy` is 1 hop app-wide. Limits live in `server/rateLimiters.js`,
  overridable per-limiter via `ISP_RATE_LIMIT_*` env vars; under `NODE_ENV=test` they default high so the rest
  of the suite doesn't trip them by accident.
- The tickers no longer deep-clone the account they just mutated, and no longer settle mining redundantly
  (ISP-43a, AB#1448): `mutateAccountState(id, mutator, { sanitize, settleMining })`, both default `true`
  (route handlers unchanged). Combined ticker event-loop share at N = 1,000 fell from 35% to 2% (PERFORMANCE.md).
- `tt-energy-routing` and `tt-material-compression`'s research effect text (AB#1259) says what it actually
  unlocks instead of a mechanic nothing read. Fixed in all three duplicated catalogs (`data/research.json`,
  `server/index.js` `RESEARCH_LIBRARY`, `public/scripts/app.js` `techTree`); unifying those three is AB#1049's
  separate scope. New schema test guards every research effect has a stated unlock or a real reader.
- An office authorizes a corporation only at the station it was rented at, while its lease has not lapsed
  (AB#1124, parallel session): hiring, renting, leasing and starting a mining cycle all read one helper,
  `activeOfficeAt(corp, stationId, now)`. Confidence medium — flagged in that PR for the Board to veto if a
  company-wide office was intended.

## Filed, not fixed (out of this session's scope)

- **AB#1744**: `tests/integration/construct-assembly.test.js` is flaky under load (~1 run in 3) — a fixed 50ms
  `setTimeout` used as a sync primitive for an async POST, not tied to the request completing.

## Blind spot

No Chrome extension connected this session (Builder panes don't get one by design), so nothing visual was
looked at. This session's own story (ISP-67) has no screen of its own — it's socket handshake and room
membership — and was verified with real `socket.io-client` connections against a real running server
(`npm test`, not a mock), which is the actual mechanism the acceptance criteria describe, not a DOM/pixel proxy
for it. `npm test`: **147 files, 1495 tests, all green** (1492 baseline on `origin/main` + 3 new). `npm run
check` (`node --check server/index.js`) and `node --check public/scripts/app.js` both clean. (AB#1124's new
refusal text is also read from two screens nobody has looked at yet, per that session's own note, still true;
AB#1747's claim was verified with a direct import of `server/index.js` and a `console.error` spy, per that
session's note.)

Screenshot-gated v0.5 items (AB#753/755/757/781/987/989) remain unclaimed for the same reason — no browser
session available.

## What's next — **paused: Board directive, 2026-09-25, no new items until told to resume**

- The market/forum "still-authenticated-looking" boundary noted above, if the Board wants it closed.
- AB#734 (ISP-48, security answers + audit) was blocked on AB#731/#732/#756 as of 2026-09-23. AB#756 is now
  done; check whether #731/#732 have landed before picking #734 up.
- The screenshot-gated v0.5 items are ready once a browser session is available.

## In flight / blocked

Nothing blocked, nothing left uncommitted. This session's branch is `agent/756-socket-boundary`, PR !392,
approved and set to auto-complete. `fix/rate-limiter-ipv6-warning` (AB#1747) already merged. Holding per the
Board's pause directive — not claiming another item.
